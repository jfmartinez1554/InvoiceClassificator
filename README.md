This repo is the final iteration of a Machine Learning Document Classification Model used for Invoice classification.

## Data Preparation:

- In order to use this repo effectively you will need a dataset that contains at least the category that you want to predict and the raw text extracted from a document, for example we used an OCR to extract all the text from a group of invoice pictures which we later compiled into a .csv file and used as our dataset.

## How to use:

- Update the global variables from the Utils notebook.
- Update the preprocessing dictionaries and utilitary functions in the Utils notebook depending on your language/preferences.
- Using the Classification Models notebook export all the models needed for the final algorithm and compare the performance of different models.
- Use the exported models or the Final Algorithm notebook to test the classification of documents!
